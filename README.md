Operating Archives VR Demo
=====================================

What is Operating Archives? 
--------------------------
The aim of my contribution to the Operating Archives project was to create an engaging
web space that allows users to interact with 3D renditions of the 17th century anatomical ivory
mannequins found in Duke University's Rubenstein Library Trent Collection. These mannequins are highly
intricate with various movable parts and due to their delicate nature, they are not allowed to be
touched by the public.2 Because of the manikins’ current inaccessibility, my goal was to make
these special objects accessible to the community. The means in which I approached this
challenge is through the creation of 3D printed renditions of the manikins and the furnishment of
a website that features an 3D-interactive demo of one of the twenty-two mannequins found in the
Trent Collection. Due to the time constraints present in this project, the website showcasing the
demo was designed as a proof of concept that was intended to lay the foundation for future
development. The end product consists of the following: 1) a physically tangible item that
viewers can touch and 2) a digital rendition that informs the viewer about its history through an
animated, clickable interface.

## Future Development
My contributions to the Operating Archives project has set the foundations for future
developments. Future contributors will need to execute the following tasks: 1) retrieve the 3D
renderings for the other manikins within the Trent Collection 2) Incorporate the demo into a
more cohesive site so viewers can access the information outside of the exhibit and 3) Scale my
demo to provide interactivity for the other manikins.
Since task 1 is dependent more so on the Rubenstein’s Library’s ability to provide the 3D
scans, I will only expand on tasks 2 and 3.

### Task 2: Furnishing a comprehensive website
Given the time constraints for this project, I was unable to furnish an comprehensive
website that would have supported my demo with links to more information on the history of
these manikins. In the next few paragraphs, I have outlined the information architecture I foresee
in future developments in the web space.

The website should be divided into two sections: 1) the archival records section and 2)
the demo section. Within the archival records section, pictures of the manikins and a brief
description of all the manikins that the Trent Collection has in their possession should be
included. Because these manikins are best appreciated when they are seen, the archival data
should be organized in an aesthetically pleasing matter. I believe that implementing a masonrystyle
layout (like the one found in Pinterest) will attract viewers. For one, the masonry layout is
primarily illustrative because it places the emphasis on the images associated with the “boards”
topic. Additionally, viewers will be accustomed to (and to a certain extent, they will expect) that
the collection be visually organized. Filtering functionality to the first section should also be
added so that the users can easily query for the type of manikin they are interested in. Filters for
gender, origin, and the presence of a wooden base would be useful.

### Task 3: Scaling the demo
Regarding task 3, scaling the demo requires future contributors to make some technical
decisions. For one, they will need to decide what type of database to use for storage. I was able
to reduce the size of the model to 1/3 of its original size, but despite this reduction I anticipate
that large amounts of storage is needed to support multiple manikins. Overall, in the future, 
students will need to design a database system that can support storing and handling these large
files.

There is also a lot of work to be done in the exhibition space. The Duke Medical Library
plans to put these manikins in a permanent exhibition. However, I have not been given any
details regarding the space or resources available to me. In the future, it will be essential to
gather as much information regarding the exhibition and proceed from there.
Given the knowledge I have accumulated thus far, I am envisioning an exhibition space
that displays these manikins in a glass encasing. I would design the space to include iPads in
front of the manikins that have a web demo available. I would also place a touchable 3D printed
version of the respective manikins beside the iPad. This way, the viewer has various options on
how to engage with these objects. I envision the options to be as follows: 1) the viewer could see
the original piece (but not touch), 2) the viewer could tinker with a 3D printed version of the
manikin, and/or 3) through tinkering, the viewer would begin the digital simulation and learn
about the manikin through an interactive animation on the iPad.
